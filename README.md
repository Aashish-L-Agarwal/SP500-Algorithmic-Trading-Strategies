# S&P500-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategies
This study focuses on building 3 trading strategies on the S&P500 ETF data. Through this research, we aim to serve two important agendas. One, is figuring out the best trading strategy for our exchange-traded fund (ETF). Second, learning about characteristics of the fund (our dataset) by experimenting with various factors and variables that influence the result of our trading strategies - which also supported in setting up a trading environment and process. For these purposes, we employed **traditional** **Mean Reversion and Crossover Strategy, and **advanced** Neural Network (MLP) Regressor model**. We found the most impressive performance from one traditional mean reversion strategy and one neural network (MLP) Regressor which are built using interesting brute-force and test-train-split approach, respectively. We also explore the possibility of combining these traditional and advanced models by constructing a **Combined Mean Reversion Neural Network MLP Model**, which produce astounding performance for our S&P500 ETF trading.

# Parts of the Research Work:

- Abstract: Provides an overview of the study's objectives and methodology.
- Introduction: Introduces the S&P500 ETF and the chosen time frame for analysis. It discusses the ETF's historical behavior.
- Methodologies: Details the processes, ground rules, and 3 algorithmic trading strategies employed for the study.
- Results and Discussions: Analyzes the performance of trading strategies using various metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and Calmar Ratio. It also includes drawdown charts.
