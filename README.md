# S&P500-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategies
This study focuses on building 3 trading strategies on the S&P500 ETF data. Through this research, we aim to serve two important agendas. One, is figuring out the best trading strategy for our exchange-traded fund (ETF). Second, learning about characteristics of the fund (our dataset) by experimenting with various factors and variables that influence the result of our trading strategies. For these purposes, we employed **traditional** **Mean Reversion and Crossover Strategy, and **advanced** Neural Network (MLP) Regressor model**. We found the most impressive performance from one traditional mean reversion strategy and one neural network (MLP) Regressor which are built using interesting brute-force and test-train-split approach, respectively. We also explore the possibility of combining these traditional and advanced models by constructing a **Combined Mean Reversion Neural Network MLP Model**, which produce astounding performance for our S&P500 ETF trading.
